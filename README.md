This Repository is to scrape the web for different Sports Data.

The first program uses BeautifulSoup to scrape basketball-reference for all the nba draft data from 1966 until 2017 and then it saves it to a csv file. The next program reads the csv file and makes graphs based on the data. There are line graphs, bar graphs, box plots, and violin graphs showing various trends in the nba draft.
